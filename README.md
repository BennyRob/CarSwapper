# CarSwapper
Car Swapper Android application made for HCI


I developed this prototype as an android application using Android Studio.
It is designed to allow users to trade vehicles with each other, the current iteration uses a local databse to function.
The target demographic is anyone who would is looking to sell their vehicle and purchase a new one. 
The goal of this app is to help indivisuals who can't afford to buy a new car while they still have their old one.
It also prevents people from having to trade into dealerships, which you can lose a lot of value on. 



You can run the application either on an emulator, or on an android phone if you have one.
I know could potentially be a hassle, but this is the only way to run it.
Also please make sure your device in on light theme instead of dark theme.


Running on an android phone:
Download the project.zip file and extract it
Move Car Swapper.apk onto android phone (USB is the easiest way to do this, just drop it in your downloads)
Install APK on phone, and launch the app


Running on an emulator:
Download Android Studio here
Install with default settings
Download the project.zip file and extract it
Open Android Studio and select “Open an existing project”, then select “Car Swapper”
Let things load for a few minutes, then in the  top right you should be able to run the application on Pixel_3a
