# CarSwapper
Car Swapper Android application made for HCI


I developed this prototype as an android application using Android Studio. 
You can run the application either on an emulator, or on an android phone if you have one.
I know could potentially be a hassle, but this is the only way to run it.
Also please make sure your device in on light theme instead of dark theme.


Running on an android phone:
Download the project.zip file and extract it
Move Car Swapper.apk onto android phone (USB is the easiest way to do this, just drop it in your downloads)
Install APK on phone, and launch the app


Running on an emulator:
Download Android Studio here
Install with default settings
Download the project.zip file and extract it
Open Android Studio and select “Open an existing project”, then select “Car Swapper”
Let things load for a few minutes, then in the  top right you should be able to run the application on Pixel_3a
